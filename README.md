Software requirements:
	Python  (https://www.python.org) (ver. 3.7)
Python package requirements:
	pytorch (https://pytorch.org) (ver. 1.2 or later)
	mrcfile (https://github.com/ccpem/mrcfile)
	numpy   (https://www.numpy.org)
	tqdm    (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

In order to run python scripts properly, users should set the python path using one of the following ways.

        1. adding python path to the header of each python script like this:

                "#!/path/to/your/python"

        2. running the scripts with the full python path like this:

                /path/to/your/python ./emnuss.py ...
Required files:
	"emd_*.map": EM density map in MRC2014 format (download from EMDB).
	"config.json": config file in JSON format. See "./6MRC/config.json".

High resolution Example: EMD-9195
#	cd 6MRC/
#	../emnuss.py -mi emd_9195.map -mo sspred.mrc -t 0.45 --output

Middle resolution Example: EMD-3329
#	cd 5FVM/
#	../emnuss.py -mi emd_3329.map -mo sspred.mrc -t 0.044 --output
Attentions: a threshold value should be provided after flag "-t". 
For better visualization, please use the author recommended contour level (or half of it).

Output files:
	"sspred.mrc": secondary structure prediction of the given map (in MRC2014 format).
	"helix.mrc" and "sheet.mrc" and "coil.mrc": predictions of 3 secondary structure classes in individual MRC2014 files (use flag "--output").
